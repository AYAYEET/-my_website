        <p>
            Being an IMS student in my third year, I posses the same abilities
            as my a lot of my friends doing an apprenticeship. This means I
            have successfully completed over 20 modules at the BZZ. This includes
            many object-oriented modules which we went through with Java, Network
            Management modules, HTML modules, PC Hardware modules and many more.
            Personally I have liked the PC Hardware and HTML/CSS modules. At the
            moment, I'm really interested in deepening my knowledge of HTML and
            working on applications for mobile devices.

            What's next?
        </h1>
        <p>
            As stated before, I am currently unsure of exactly what I would like to
            study. I do however know, that I would like to go on to study after my
            internship. Currently I am very interested in a program called "International
            IT Management" at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts or
            also going in the direction of Cybersecurity.
