            Badminton and other sports

        <p>
            Ever since I started playing badminton all the way back in the fifth
            grade, I have loved it. It started out for me as a school sport, that
            I joined as one of my friends had been loving it. I joined the class
            and haven't looked back since! I went on to train at the Badminton
            Club Adliswil and eventually began to play less and help out with the
            younger players. I also enjoy mountain biking, as I live on the Albis
            a perfect place to do some mountain biking. Whilst I'm in Canada each
            year I love to do water sports, such as water skiing or kayaking.

           Computers and Informatics
        </h1>

        <p>
            The first full computer I ever built was back in 2015. I remember
            wanting to build one for a very long time. Then all the stars aligned
            and I finally got the chance to build one. I loved it. After that I
            built a few more for my friends and even for a few people
            on Tutor24. My latest and favorite creation is the one I built
            for my father, where we went all out on everything.<br>
            As we don't do nearly enough informatics at school, I've taken it
            into my own hands to get to know some things a bit more. I've
            recently been getting to know the language Swift and Xcode along
            with it. I've also loved experimenting with HTML and CSS on this
            website.

            Photography
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now I wouldn't call myself a photographer or anything like that, but
            I've always loved to take pictures of things. To be a bit more
            exact, dogs. I've added a link here which, should you be interested
            will lead you to an <a href="https://omfgdogs.com"> Instagram account</a>
            I created to sum up my love for
            my dog and also a few pictures of some of my favorite computers I've
            built.
