        <p>
            I was born on the 9th of January 2002 in Toronto, Canada.
            Both my parents are from two very different parts of the world, allowing
            me to have insight into two very different cultures. My father works
            in a Bank, while my mother has always stayed home to take care of
            my sister and I. My sister is attends the gymnasium Wiedikon.
        </p>

            Childhood
        </h1>
        <p>
            A few years after having me, my family decided to move to Switzerland.
            I had to catch up on all the german I had missed in those
            years, which was very hard on me at times. But it taught me to push on
            and gave me the mindset I have now, towards learning new things.
            I also attended Karate lessons from the age of seven up until a few
            years ago, which taught me to always be patient and respectful. During
            this time, I always remember loving technology, whether it be
            jailbreaking my old devices or just messing around and taking apart
            computers.

            Future Plans
        </h1>
        <p>
            Currently I am working on finding an internship starting next summer.
            After that, my current plan is to go on to study Informatics
            at one of the Fachhochschulen in Switzerland. Exactly what I would
            like to study, I hope to find out during my internship.
